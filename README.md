# FLStudioFREE
So this is nothing "major" or ground breaking while reversing FL Studio 20 i noticed some un-encrypted strings linking to the registry and i was like this seems interesting what could happen if i change/removed them and i changed up some stuff within my reversal tool to obviously make this work and not have it run multiple checks to see if i have paid or not 

## how to use
first use REMOVE_FL if you have installed fl studio and then flregkey 
then boom you have FL Studio Free :)
